    <h4>A Sloppy Joe is a sandwich consisting of ground beef and onions in a tomato-based sauce served on a hamburger
        bun.
        <br>
        The sandwich likely originated in Sioux City, Iowa in the 1930s. According to legend, the "loose meat sandwich"
        was the creation of a cook named Joe.
